## Getting started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then make some changes to the code in [`src`](src), and test the frontend locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Before creating a PR, format the code:

```bash
npm run format
```

And check for any issues:

```bash
npm run check
```

Then you can [create a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to merge the changes.
